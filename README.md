# DESCRIPTION
The goal of this parser is to fetch a cURL result on URL of any GeneWeb version prior to 7.0, and transform it in CSV with normalisation ability.

All surnames are set-up with the normalisation options you gave, the French Republican dates are transformed, and some housekeeping is done.

# USAGE

```
genea.pl [-v <LEVEL>] [-s <SOSA>] [-t <LEVEL>] [-T] [-N] [-i <INPUT> [-u <URL>] ] [-o <OUTPUT>] [-h|-?]
        -v <LEVEL>  : With <LEVEL> value between 0 (quiet) and 6 (xtra trace).
        -s <SOSA>   : Only process given Sosa number <SOSA>.
	-N          : Disable case normalisation.
	-T          : Disable title catching.
        -t <LEVEL>  : Tree format display, by surname branches, with <LEVEL> as max depth.
        -i <INPUT>  : Input file. If this flag is omitted, the parser will use STDIN.
        -u <URL>    : URL to fetch and save to INPUT file, before processing this file. -i is mandatory, the file will be replaced.
        -o <OUTPUT> : Output file. If omitted, will use STDOUT.

Be careful. The order of the switches is important, and cURL on <URL> is done immediately, before looking up at the other switches.
